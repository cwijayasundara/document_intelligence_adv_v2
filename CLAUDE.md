# PE Document Intelligence Platform

Document intelligence platform for private equity — processes LPA and Subscription Agreement documents through upload, parse, edit, classify, extract, summarize, ingest, and retrieve workflows. Uses DeepAgents (LangGraph) with GPT-5.4-mini for classification, extraction, judging, summarization, and RAG retrieval.

## Quick Reference

**Backend:** `cd backend && uv run pytest -x -q` | `uv run ruff check --fix .` | `uv run mypy src/`
**Frontend:** `cd frontend && npm test` | `npm run lint` | `npm run typecheck`
**Infra:** `docker compose up -d` (PostgreSQL 16 + Weaviate)
**Full stack:** `./init.sh`

## Architecture

Strict layered architecture: Types → Config → Repository → Service → API → UI.
One-way dependencies only. See `.claude/architecture.md` for full rules.

## Pipeline Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/brd` | Socratic interview → BRD |
| `/spec` | BRD → stories + features.json |
| `/design` | Architecture + schemas + mockups |
| `/build` | Full 8-phase pipeline |
| `/auto` | Autonomous ratcheting loop |
| `/implement` | Code gen with agent teams |
| `/evaluate` | Run app, verify contract |
| `/review` | Evaluator + security review |
| `/test` | Test plan + Playwright E2E |
| `/deploy` | Docker Compose + init.sh |

## Code Style

- TDD mandatory: test first, then implement
- 100% meaningful coverage target, 80% floor
- Functions < 50 lines, files < 300 lines
- Static typing everywhere (zero `any`)
- See `.claude/skills/code-gen/SKILL.md` for full rules

## Git

Branch: `<type>/<description>` (e.g., `feat/user-auth`)
Commits: conventional format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`)
